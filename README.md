Simple Text Calculator for HCS12 Microcontroller

- This program reads the string starting from $1200 and computes the results accordingly.  

- For instance if starting from $1200 the memory has the string “28.33 + 17.28 =” then the program will compute the result and write it to address $1500.  

- Strings always end with ‘=’. Put the string at $1200 using ORG and FCC directives.  

- Store the integer and decimal parts in different memory locations and perform arithmetic operation accordingly.  

- The arithmetic operation can be either ‘+’ or ‘-‘.  

- The integer part can’t be larger than 255, whereas the decimal part can’t have more than two digits, i.e. 0.XY.  Warn if overflow occurs by writing $FF to PORTB. Otherwise PORTB will be written $55.
